.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Prints out Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) configurations.
.LP
Since RAPL does not implement all capabilities defined in the powercap interface, only a subset of the options seen powercap-info(1) are available.
Additionally, the \-p and \-z options are different.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
\fB\-h,\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints out the help screen
.TP
\fB\-v,\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print errors when files are not available
.TP
\fB\-p,\fR \fB\-\-package\fR=\fIPACKAGE\fP
The package number (none by default; 0 by default if using \-z/\-\-subzone and/or \-c/\-\-constraint). Ending with a colon prevents output for subzones. E.g., for package 0, but not subzones:
.br
\fB\-p 0:\fP
.TP
\fB\-z,\fR \fB\-\-subzone=\fR\fISUBZONE\fP
The package subzone number (none by default)
.TP
\fB\-c,\fR \fB\-\-constraint\fR=\fICONSTRAINT\fP
The constraint number (none by default)
.TP
All remaining options below are mutually exclusive:
.TP
\fB\-n,\fR \fB\-\-nzones\fR
Print the number of packages found, or the number of subzones found if \-p/\-\-package is set
.TP
The following are zone-level arguments (\-z/\-\-subzone is optional):
.TP
\fB\-j,\fR \fB\-\-z\-energy\fR
Print zone energy counter
.TP
\fB\-J,\fR \fB\-\-z\-max\-energy\-range\fR
Print zone maximum energy counter range
.TP
\fB\-e,\fR \fB\-\-z\-enabled\fR
Print zone enable/disabled status
.TP
\fB\-x,\fR \fB\-\-z\-name\fR

.TP
The following are constraint-level arguments and require \-c/\-\-constraint (\-z/\-\-subzone is optional):
.TP
\fB\-l,\fR \fB\-\-c\-power\-limit\fR
Print constraint power limit
.TP
\fB\-s,\fR \fB\-\-c\-time\-window\fR
Print constraint time window
.TP
\fB\-U,\fR \fB\-\-c\-max\-power\fR
Print constraint maximum allowed power
.TP
\fB\-y,\fR \fB\-\-c\-name\fR
Print constraint name
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
Note that \-p/\-\-package=0 is used by default when also specifying \-z/\-\-subzone and/or \-c/\-\-constraint, allowing for simpler commands on single-socket systems.
.TP
To print all RAPL zones:
\fBrapl\-info\fP
.TP
To print only package 0, which is usually named "package\-0":
\fBrapl\-info \-p 0\fP
.TP
To print package 0, subzone 1, which is usually the "uncore" or "dram" subzone of "package\-0", depending on the system:
\fBrapl\-info \-p 0 \-z 1\fP
.TP
To print package 0, constraint 1, which is usually the "short_term" constraint for "package\-0":
\fBrapl\-info \-p 0 \-c 1\fP
.TP
To print the energy counter for package 0, which is usually named "package\-0":
\fBrapl\-info \-p 0 \-j\fP
.TP
To print the power limit for package 1, subzone 0, constraint 0, which is usually the "long_term" constraint for the "core" subzone of "package\-1" (a multi\-socket system):
\fBrapl\-info \-p 1 \-z 0 \-c 0 \-l\fP
.SH "REMARKS"
.LP
A package is a zone with constraints.
Subzones are a package's child domains, including power planes.
.LP
If no subzone/constraint-specific outputs are requested, all available zones and constraints will be shown.

Energy units: microjoules (uJ)
.br
Power units: microwatts (uW)

Time units: microseconds (us)
.SH "BUGS"
.LP
The following are behavioral quirks due to the kernel interface or abnormalities in some hardware.
They are not bugs in \fBrapl\-info\fR and should not be reported as such.
.LP
Values returned by the kernel sometimes lose accuracy from the actual values stored in Model-Specific Registers due to integer rounding.
For example, the kernel may return a time window value of 7812 us, when in fact the actual stored value is 7812.5 us.
Writing back a value returned by the kernel, e.g., using rapl\-set(1), may cause unexpected changes to its value due to these rounding problems.
.LP
On some systems, the constraint max_power_uw file, e.g., constraint_0_max_power_uw, is known to receive an ENODATA (No data available) error from the kernel for some zones other than "package".
So even though the file exists, a value may not be printed for it.
.LP
It is possible for packages on multi-socket systems to be indexed out of order by the kernel.
For example, the package at index 0 (\fB\-p 0\fR) could actually be named "package\-1" while the package at index 1 (\fB\-p 1\fR) is named "package\-0".
